LAB No. 8 
Implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network

Question No. 1
Using the given LSTM next-word prediction model and tokenizer, write the code to input a sentence, convert it into sequences, pad it, and predict the next word using the trained model.

Question No. 2
Train an LSTM model on your chosen text dataset and write the code to predict the next word for a user-given input sentence.
Question No. 3
Modify the next-word prediction code so that the model generates 5 new words sequentially instead of just one.
