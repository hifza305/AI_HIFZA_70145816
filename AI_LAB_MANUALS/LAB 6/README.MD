Implementation of Deep Neural Network

Practice Question 1: 
DNN Architecture Design
Create a Deep Neural Network to predict whether a student passes or fails using features such as study hours and attendance.
•	Use at least three hidden layers
•	Experiment with different numbers of neurons
•	Compare the accuracy with a shallow ANN (one hidden layer)
Practice Question 2: 
Activation Function Analysis
Using the Iris dataset, build two DNN models:
•	Model A: Use ReLU activation in all hidden layers
•	Model B: Use tanh activation in all hidden layers
Train both models and compare their accuracy and training behavior. Write your observation.

Practice Question 3:
 Hyperparameter Tuning in DNN
Train a DNN on the MNIST dataset by changing:
•	Number of hidden layers
•	Number of neurons per layer
•	Batch size
Record how these changes affect training time and accuracy
Practice Question 4: 
Overfitting and Regularization
Build a deep neural network on any classification dataset and:
•	Observe signs of overfitting
•	Apply at least one regularization technique (Dropout or Early Stopping
