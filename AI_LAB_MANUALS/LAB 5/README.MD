Implementation of Artificial Neural Network

Question 1
Logic Gates with Neural Network. Implement a feed-forward neural network to learn the AND gate.
•	Inputs: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
•	Output: 0, 0, 0, 1
Tasks:
1.	Create dataset using NumPy or pandas.
2.	Build a neural network with one hidden layer using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
3.	Train it and show accuracy.
4.	Compare model predictions with actual outputs
Question 2
Create a dataset y = x² + noise for x in range [-3,3]. Regression Task with Neural Network
Tasks:
1.	Generate 100 samples.
2.	Build a neural network to predict y from x.
3.	Plot actual vs. predicted results.
4.	Discuss how increasing hidden neurons changes results.
Question 3:
Use the XOR gate and train networks with different activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU).
•	Compare accuracy, loss, and convergence speed.
•	Plot and discuss results.


Question 4
